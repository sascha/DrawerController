# Drawer Controller for Swift 3

`DrawerController` is a swift version of the popular `MMDrawerController` by [Mutual Mobile](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController), converted by @sascha (https://github.com/sascha/DrawerController), which unfortunately has been stale for a while so I'm making the Swift 3 version for self use at the moment - will see if it will pick up again after Swift 3 is released.

## Installation


#### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

````ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'DrawerController', :git => 'https://github.com/hyouuu/DrawerController.git'
````
